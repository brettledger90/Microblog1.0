# Microblog1.0
------------------------
Part 1
In this project I was able to intsall and do some implementaion with FLASK. I created a virtual environment, and was able to display "Hello World" on the server.

Step one $ brew install pipenv, 
Step two clone the repo and $ cd Microblog1.0
Step three  install python using $ pipenv install --python 3.7
Step four install flask $ pipenv install flask
Step five $ pipenv install flake8


once we have everything installed we are able to see what it actually does, so let's start our venv by first setting it $ export FLASK_APP=microblog.py, once we've set that we can now run a $ flask run , follow the link to the server and get ready for a gasp!
------------------------------------------
Part 2
In part two we will build of part 1 by implamenting some templates, and work with some inherant templates as well.

First I add a base.html, and a index.html
in inserted my code and was able to render a little more with the templates.

To run this, first use $ export FLASK_APP=microblog.py 
then a simple $ flas run should get you off and running.
